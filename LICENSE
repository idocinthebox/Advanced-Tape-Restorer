COMMERCIAL USE DISCLAIMER

While this software (Advanced Tape Restorer) is MIT licensed and permits
commercial use, some bundled AI models may have restrictions. Users engaging
in commercial video restoration must:

1. Review individual AI model licenses in ai_models/models/registry.yaml
2. Obtain necessary permissions for restricted models
3. Consider using only commercially-licensed models (RealESRGAN, BasicVSR++,
   SwinIR, RIFE, DeOldify)
4. Disable or avoid models with non-commercial restrictions (GFPGAN, ProPainter)
