## Legal Questions & Answers

### Q: Can I fork v4.1 and sell my own version?
**A:** Yes! v4.1 is MIT licensed. You can:
- Fork the v4.1 codebase
- Add your own features
- Sell your modified version
- Redistribute freely

You must:
- Include the original MIT license
- Credit the original authors
- Not claim you created the original v4.1 code

### Q: Can I use v4.1 in my commercial video production business?
**A:** Yes! MIT license allows unlimited commercial use.

### Q: If I buy v4.2, can I share it with my team?
**A:** No. Each user requires their own license (single-user license). For teams:
- Buy multiple individual licenses, or
- Contact us for volume discounts, or
- Wait for v5.0 Enterprise (multi-user licensing)

### Q: Can I decompile v4.2 to see how proprietary features work?
**A:** No. Reverse engineering proprietary components violates the license and terminates your license immediately.

### Q: What if I build the v4.2 features myself using v4.1?
**A:** You can! v4.1 is MIT, so you can extend it however you want. The v4.2 license only restricts redistribution of **our proprietary implementation** of those features.

### Q: Can I use v4.1 components in my own software?
**A:** Yes! MIT license allows this. You can extract code from v4.1 and use it in your projects (open source or commercial), as long as you include the MIT license text.

### Q: Why dual licensing instead of fully open source?
**A:** 
- v4.1 provides powerful free tools for everyone
- v4.2 commercial features fund ongoing development
- Dual licensing lets us:
  - Keep core features free and open
  - Develop professional features sustainably
  - Offer affordable pricing ($45 early supporter)
  - Maintain the project long-term

### Q: Will v4.1 continue to receive updates?
**A:** v4.1 will receive:
- ✅ Security patches
- ✅ Bug fixes for core features
- ✅ Compatibility updates (new FFmpeg/VapourSynth versions)
- ❌ New professional features (those are v4.2+)

### Q: Can I "downgrade" from v4.2 to v4.1 MIT?
**A:** Yes! You can always use v4.1 (MIT) instead. Simply:
- Download v4.1 from GitHub
- You keep your v4.2 license (non-refundable)
- Continue using v4.1 under MIT terms
